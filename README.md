# Airline_Passenger_Data
 Analyze monthly passenger traffic data to identify trends for each airline and overall trends.
### Business Understanding
Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize trends in monthly passenger traffic for various airlines over time. This helps in understanding seasonal patterns, overall growth, and variations in passenger traffic, which could be crucial for optimizing airline operations and resource allocation.

Questions:
- What are the trends in passenger traffic over the years?
- Are there any noticeable seasonal patterns in passenger traffic?
- How does the overall passenger traffic trend look when visualized over the entire time period?
### Data Understanding
Data Collection: The dataset flights.csv was used, containing information on monthly passenger traffic, years, and months.
Data Description:
- The dataset includes columns like year, month, and passengers.
- There are a total of flight.shape[0] records.

Key variables:
- year: The year of the flight data.
- month: The month of the flight data.
- passengers: The number of passengers for that month and year.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- You examined the first and last few rows of the dataset using flight.head() and flight.tail() to understand the structure.
- Summary statistics were generated with flight.describe().
- Checked the data types and presence of null values with flight.info() and flight.isnull().
- Unique values in the year column were determined using flight['year'].unique().
### Data Preparation
Data Cleaning:
- The dataset appears to be clean with no missing values, as inferred from the flight.isnull().sum() result.
- A new column Date was created by combining year and month columns using pd.to_datetime(flight['year'].astype(str) + '-' + flight['month']) to represent the date of the flight data.
- Converted the year column to a string for concatenation and then to a datetime object to facilitate time series analysis.
### Visualization:
- Monthly Passenger Traffic by Year: Plotted the monthly passenger traffic for each year using a line plot. This visualization helps in identifying seasonal patterns and comparing traffic across different years.
- Overall Passenger Traffic Trend: Created a line plot to visualize the overall trend of passenger traffic across the entire dataset. This plot helps in understanding the general trend over time, whether it's increasing, decreasing, or stable.
### Evaluation
Model Performance:
- The visualizations effectively captured the seasonal trends and overall traffic patterns. They answered the key business questions by showing how passenger traffic varies by year and overall trends.
- The airline can use these insights to plan for peak seasons, allocate resources efficiently, and potentially identify underlying causes of any observed trends.
